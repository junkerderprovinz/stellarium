# Prints the screen size the X server should be started with, or nothing when
# neither variable is set (then the base image's own default applies).
#
# SHARED FILE: byte-identical in every junkerderprovinz image that builds on
# linuxserver/baseimage-selkies. Fix it in one place, copy it to the others.
#
# Why two variables: Unraid renders a template variable as a plain <select> as
# soon as its Default contains a "|" (see CreateDocker.php, addConfig()), so a
# dropdown of presets and a free-text field cannot be the same field. The
# template therefore offers MAX_RES as the preset dropdown and MAX_RES_CUSTOM
# as a free field, and this script decides between them:
#
#   MAX_RES_CUSTOM set and usable  -> that value wins
#   otherwise                      -> MAX_RES as chosen in the dropdown
#
# A malformed value is REPORTED AND IGNORED rather than passed on. Xvfb takes
# the screen size as a literal command line argument, so a typo like
# "1920*1080" would stop the X server from starting at all and the container
# would come up with no desktop. Falling back keeps a working session and says
# what happened; the opposite trade turns a five-second mistake into a dead
# container.
#
# Spellings people actually type are accepted: surrounding spaces, spaces
# around the separator, and a capital X.

# which swallows every line the openbox session and its children write — our
# autostart's diagnostics and anything Stellarium prints to the session.
# Identical to the base script otherwise, incl. the Nvidia/zink block.
# (The "STELLARIUM IS READY" banner is a separate s6 service and is unaffected;
# this is purely about keeping the desktop log visible in `docker logs`.)
